Author: 
Modified by: Phillip Quinlan, Endre Bernhardt, Alan Crow.
Modified by: Shaun Narayan (01/27/10, AUT Upstage team 09/10) - 
                Fix render crash on manage avatar page if no stages exist. (Error msg)
Modified by: Shaun Narayan (02/16/10) - Added media list method, and removed old methods
                which are no longer required. Changed update_from_form to work with new forms.
Modified by: 18/05/11 Mohammed Al-Timimi and Heath Behrens - created the method get_formatted_list which was being used
                by things.py but didn't exist
Modified by: Heath Behrens (17/06/2011) - added fix so that a voice change does not require a server restart, to show. 
             update_from_form lines 302 - 307
Modified by: Heath Behrens 16/08/2011 - added code in update_from_form to extract assigned/unassigned stages
                                      and process accordingly.
             Heath, Corey, Karena 24/08/2011 - Added tags to media collection, as part of server side tagging of things                         
             Heath Behrens / Vibhu Patel 24/08/2011 - Added code to retrieve the tags from form and update the collection.
                                                    - Note the tags are retrieved from the collection first then 
                                                      re added to keep the current tags            
             Heath Behrens / Corey / Karena 26/08/2011 - Added code to update media name, along with a fix for tags which kept adding
                                                        a blank tag when saving name.
